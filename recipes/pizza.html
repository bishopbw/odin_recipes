    <h1>All about pizza:</h1>
    <p>Originating in Naples, Italy, during the 18th century, pizza has evolved from a simple street food to a worldwide culinary sensation. Traditionally, Neapolitan pizza featured a
     thin crust topped with tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, olive oil, and fresh basil leaves, representing the colors of the Italian flag. As it gained popularity, variations emerged, 
     incorporating a wide array of toppings to suit different tastes. In the late 19th century, Italian immigrants introduced pizza to the United States, where it quickly captivated the 
     American palate. Over the years, this humble dish has undergone numerous transformations, giving rise to styles like New York, Chicago deep-dish, and gourmet artisanal pizzas. Today, 
     pizza is cherished globally for its delicious versatility and remains a beloved comfort food enjoyed by people of all ages.</p>
