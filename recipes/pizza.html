    <h1>All about pizza:</h1>
    <p>Originating in Naples, Italy, during the 18th century, pizza has evolved from a simple street food to a worldwide culinary sensation. Traditionally, Neapolitan pizza featured a
     thin crust topped with tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, olive oil, and fresh basil leaves, representing the colors of the Italian flag. As it gained popularity, variations emerged, 
     incorporating a wide array of toppings to suit different tastes. In the late 19th century, Italian immigrants introduced pizza to the United States, where it quickly captivated the 
     American palate. Over the years, this humble dish has undergone numerous transformations, giving rise to styles like New York, Chicago deep-dish, and gourmet artisanal pizzas. Today, 
     pizza is cherished globally for its delicious versatility and remains a beloved comfort food enjoyed by people of all ages.</p>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <p>Steps 1-4 may be ignored if using a pre-bought pizza crust. For best results, make your own!</p>
        <li>In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in the warm water. (For homemade crust)</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, add the salt, garlic powder, and 1/2 of the flour. Stir to combine. Add the warm water/yeast mixture and the olive oil. Use a wooden spoon to stir well, then gradually stir in the remaining cup of flour. Continue to stir until an elastic ball has formed, slightly sticking to the sides of the bowl.</li>
        <li>Dust your hands with flour and knead the dough in the bowl for 3-5 minutes. If the dough becomes too sticky, gradually add additional flour in small dustings, up to 1/3 cup additional. If you poke the dough with your finger and it slowly comes back, it’s ready to rise. Shape into a ball.        </li>
        <li>Drizzle a separate large glass bowl with a little olive oil and use a pastry brush to distribute the oil on the bottom and sides. Add the ball of dough. Cover with plastic wrap and allow it to rise for 30-60+ minutes, until doubled in size. (This gives time to for the gluten to develop, which allows the dough to stretch without breaking.) You can also let it rise in the fridge overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450° F during the last 30+ minutes to ensure it has plenty of time to get fully up to temperature. Place the pizza pan (or stone) in the oven as it preheats.</li>
        <li>Gently punch down the dough and knead it 5 times to smooth it out.</li>
        <li>Spread the dough into an even 12-inch circle, either with your hands or with a rolling pin. (I also like to use my fingers to form a crust along the edge.)</li>
        <li>Remove the pizza pan from the oven and sprinkle it with a thin, even layer of flour. Transfer the dough onto it.</li>
        <li>Use a fork to gently poke holes in the dough to prevent the crust from bubbling up as it bakes. Drizzle it with 1 tablespoon olive oil and use a pastry brush to spread it out over the dough.</li>
        <li>Top with pizza sauce, cheese, and toppings.</li>
        <li>Bake for 13-15 minutes. Even if the cheese is melted, give the crust enough time to cook and crisp on the bottom, resist the urge to remove it too early, but don’t let it get too brown on the top. Mine takes 15 minutes exactly.</li>
        <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and use a spatula to lift the crust to check the bottom, ensuring it’s slightly browned and crisp.</li>
        <li>Garnish with parsley, grated Parmesan, and red pepper flakes if desired. Slice and serve!</li>
