    <h1>A bit of information on Sushi:</h1>
    <p>Originating in ancient Japan, sushi has a rich history dating back over a thousand years. Initially, it was a preservation technique, where fish was fermented with rice and 
    salt to extend its shelf life. Over time, this method evolved into the artful preparation of vinegared rice combined with fresh fish, vegetables, and sometimes seaweed. In the 19th century, 
    Edo-style sushi gained popularity in Tokyo as a quick and affordable street food. The introduction of refrigeration in the 20th century revolutionized sushi, enabling the creation of diverse 
    and delicate flavors. Today, sushi is celebrated worldwide for its balance of flavors, meticulous presentation, and the skillful craftsmanship that has made it an iconic and beloved dish.</p>
